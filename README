Hanging out on #makerbot as codeXmas


Purpose?
-----------------------
1. To be able to use a Makerbot without a computer attached, or having to start a print from the SD card via ReplicatorG.
2. Control a Makerbot externally by simulating the serial protocol that ReplicatorG implements.
3. Provide as much functionality as ReplicatorG control panel without hacking the firmware for the machine.
4. Learn C/C++ and hack things with Arduino


What do you need?
-----------------------
1. An Arduino of any form that is an ATMega328 or greater <http://www.solarbotics.com/products/kardw/> $10 Super compact version.
2. A 3 pin 38kHz IR Receiver module. I used <TSOP39238CZ1>
3. A 16x2 LCD that is HD44780 compatible. Will also need a 10k pot for contrast control.
4. <optional> Piezo buzzer for future audio feedback.
5. External Libraries
    a) MenuBackend
    b) IRremote
    c) LiquidCrystal

I used the LED on Pin 13 as a status light, part of the Ardweeny kit.


How do I make it work?
-----------------------
First off, breadboard the parts together using the pinouts that are specified in the Sketch.
Then attach jumper wires from Pin 0 and Pin 1 for the Rx/Tx lines on the Arduino to the Makerbot FTDI header pins 4&5.
They might be reversed, so if you are getting no response at all, swap the Rx/Tx wires and try again.
