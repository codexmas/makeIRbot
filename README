Hanging out on #makerbot as codeXmas


Purpose?
-----------------------
1. To be able to use a Makerbot without a computer attached, or having to start
    a print from the SD card via ReplicatorG.
2. Control a Makerbot externally by simulating the serial protocol that
    ReplicatorG implements.
3. Provide as much functionality as ReplicatorG control panel without hacking
    the firmware for the machine.
4. Learn C/C++ and hack things with Arduino


What do you need?
-----------------------
1. An Arduino of any form that is an ATMega328 or greater.
    <http://www.solarbotics.com/products/kardw/> $10 Super compact version.
2. A 3 pin 38kHz IR Receiver module. I used <TSOP39238CZ1>
3. A 16x2 LCD that is HD44780 compatible. Will also need a 10k pot for contrast
    control.
4. <optional> Piezo buzzer for future audio feedback.
5. Libraries Used
    a) MenuBackend <http://www.arduino.cc/playground/uploads/Profiles/MenuBackend_1-4.zip>
    b) IRremote <https://github.com/shirriff/Arduino-IRremote/>
    c) LiquidCrystal <Built-in Arduino Library>

I used the LED on Pin 13 as a status light, part of the Ardweeny kit, and most
every Arduino out there


How do I make it work?
-----------------------
First off, breadboard the parts together using the pinouts that are specified in
the Sketch. You will need a +5v source, I used an extra floppy drive connector
from the bot. Pins on it are Red [+5v] Black [GND] Black [GND] Yellow [+12v]

Then attach jumper wires from Pin 0 and Pin 1 for the Rx/Tx lines on the Arduino to
the Makerbot FTDI header pins 4&5.

They might be reversed, so if you are getting no response at all, swap the Rx/Tx
wires and try again.

The Debug menu will show the raw data that has been received in the last packet.
It also shows the command that was sent, the command code received, the payload
size, as well as the CRC on the first line.
